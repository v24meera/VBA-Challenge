UT Data Analysis Bootcamp Challenge 2: VBA 
Homework Module 2 Challenge 

I utilized resources from Google and watched YouTube videos and chat GPT to aid in completing this assignment. Due to the unavailability of tutors during my working hours, I used these platforms strictly for guidance on coding and clarifying concepts that arose outside typical office hours support. The code presented in this repository is authored by me, with the aforementioned resources used solely for supplementary learning purposes.

This disclosure aims to provide transparency to the grading staff regarding the circumstances under which external resources were consulted, ensuring clarity and avoiding any misinterpretation of my work as plagiarized.
